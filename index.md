#  Ethics in GIS; Applications & Research; Final Exam Review   

This module will cover public engagement in and ethical implications of GIS; applications and research in GIS; and wrap up any other loose ends we need to cover before the exam!

## Final Projects

Projects are due **June 22nd**.  They will be accepted up to 7 days late **however**, the extra time will be considered when marking.  Later submissions will be marked more harshly.

**A note on participation**:  it is up to group members to determine the allocation of the work for the project.  However, if there are severe discrepancies in participation, I can and will adjust individual marks accordingly.  If there are serious participation issues, please reach out to me after submitting the project.
