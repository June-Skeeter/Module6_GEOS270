## Flowchart (50 pts x1)

Tests your ability to work through a problem using GIS methods.  Create a flow chart outlining a GIS analysis in response to a prompt.  I suggest you use [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) because its easy to create clean flowcharts quickly.  But you can do it however you'd like.
* When exporting to submit, make sure to export/submit a .png, .jpg, or .pdf
