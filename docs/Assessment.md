All quiz answers are multiple choice, numeric input, fill in the blank, etc. type questions.  They can be submitted via the Module 1 Quiz that can be found on the Canvas page.  You will have unlimited attempts to take the quiz.

## Application Questions (40pts)

[**QA1**](Application_Part3.md#qa1)
For every $100 increase in income at the CT level, how much does rental price increase?

[**QA2**](Application_Part3.md#qa2)
What is the r2 score for this model?

[**QA3**](Application_Part3.md#qa3)
Which Census Unit displays a more direct relationship between income and housing?
- DA
- CT
- About the same

[**Q4**](Application_Part3.md#qa3)
Which value denotes the lower bound of the "Green Vegetation Class?"

[**Q5**](Application_Part4.md#qa5)
What is the DAUID of the DA with the highest Mean NDVI value?  *Hint* Double clicking on Green Veg Area in the attribute table allows you to sort in ascending/descending order.

[**Q6**](Application_Part4.md#qa6)
What is the DAUID of the DA with the highest Green Veg Area?

[**QA7**](Application_Part4.md#qa7)
Is the DA with the highest mean NDVI value the same as the DA with the greatest area of green vegetation? Y/N

[**QA8**](Application_Part4.md#qa8)
Create a scatter plot, with the Mean NDVI value (Output from Method 1) on the X-axis and Green Veg Area Sum (Output from Method 2) on the Y-axis.  What is the R2 value? 

[**QA9**](Application_Part4.md#qa9)
The r2 score indicates Mean NDVI value is [Strong/Moderate/Weak/Very Weak] predictor of Green Veg Area.

[**QA10**](Application_Part4.md#qa10)
Change the Y-axis to Income and leave the X-axis as Mean NDVI, note the R2 score.  Now change the X-axis to the Green Veg Area Sum and note the R2 score.  Which variable has a "stronger" relationship with income? [Green Veg Area/Mean NDVI]

[**QA11**](Application_Part4.md#qa11)
Are either of these variables strongly linked to income? [Yes/No/Just Mean NDIV/Just Green Veg Area]

[**QA12**](Application_Part5.md#qa12)
Create a scatter plot, with the Mean NDVI value (Output from Method 1) on the X-axis and Green Vegetation Fraction (Normalized Output from Method 2) on the Y-axis.  What is the R2 value? 

[**QA13**](Application_Part5.md#qa13)
The r2 score indicates Mean NDVI value is [Strong/Moderate/Weak/Very Weak] predictor of Green Veg Area.

## Content Questions

[**QC1**](Content_Part1.md#qc1)
The ______ data model represents space as a continuous grid of ______ which each contain a single ______.

[**QC2**](Content_Part1.md#qc2)
The ______ data model represents features in space as discrete two-dimensional ______ , one-dimensional ______ , and/or "zero-dimensional"  points.  Attribute information is stored separately in a ______.

[**QC3**](Content_Part2.md#qc3)
______ objects have well defined boundaries.  They are countable, meaning there is only a ______ number of them.


[**QC4**](Content_Part2.md#qc4)
______ fields lack well defined boundaries.  Because of this, they can be measured at an ______ number of locations.


[**QC5**](Content_Part2.md#qc5)
Both types of phenomena can be represented using either the raster or vector data model.  However, ______ phenomena are generally better represented by the vector model and ______ phenomena are better represented by the raster data model.

[**QC6**](Content_Part2.md#qc6)
Higher resolution rasters have smaller cells which means they take less memory to store [T/F]

[**QC7**](Content_Part2.md#qc7)
The ______ problem pertains to how we assign data values to grid cells that cover more than one value.

[**QC8**](Content_Part2.md#qc8)
Resolution is a property of the [data/map/both], scale is a property of the [data/map/both].

[**QC9**](Content_Part2.md#qc9)
Polygons in a vector dataset can be single part or multipart [T/F].

# Module Assignment (60 pts)

All written answers should be numbered and record in one document, saved as a .pdf, and uploaded to canvas.  The file submissions should also be saved as .pdf and uploaded as a separate document.  **Written answers can be as brief as you want as long as they answer the question.**

## Application Questions

### Written Answers

[**WA1**](Application_Part2.md#wa1)
What is NDVI and what is it used for?  Describe the patterns you see in NDVI across the metro Vancouver area.


[**WA2**](Application_Part3.md#wa3)
What are the differences you notice between the CTs and DAs in terms of size and population?
