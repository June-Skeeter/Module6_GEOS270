# Public Participation
{: .no_toc }

There are many ways the public can be involved in GIS; the can participate actively or passively.  Engagement is crucial in many ways.

## Volunteer Geographic Information

The collection, processing, assembly, and dissemination of geographic data provided voluntarily by individuals.  Is sometimes, part of participatory approaches to GIS; sometimes its just using freely provided information that people are unaware of.  This is equally likely to be used for commercial purposes as it is for participatory, educational, and other non-commercial uses: E.g. Trip Advisor, Flickr, Twitter, etc.  Usually some sort of "wisdom of the crowds" is used to validate data, or else data verification and validation is performed by the organizing group

### Area Racism and Health Outcomes

Volunteered data isn't always volunteered willingly/knowingly.  For example, we can use google search metadata to find out things people might not willingly share themselves.

### WA1
Read the highlighted portions of [this study](content/Chae_et_al_2015.pdf) on racism and health outcomes.  Then use this information to a couple paragraphs outlining what they found, how the type of data they used can be a useful alternative for traditional metrics, and what are some potential limitations to this type of research.

## Citizen Science

Allows interested volunteers and researchers to team up to address some scientific question.  Volunteers provide the “leg work” of data collection, data cleaning, and initial interpretation of field data.  Guided by scientific research experts.  Participation levels can range from simple data collection through to contributing to academic journal submission.

## Participatory GIS

The primary goals of PGIS are the empowerment and inclusion of marginalized people.  These groups tend to have little or no voice in the public arena due to extremes of location, poverty, racism, sexism, anti-religious feelings, or political disempowerment.  Often begins through a process of community mapping, with many steps and a set of long-term goals for the community.

* Have members of the community generate their own data and construct their own maps
* Bring members together to share their maps
* Combine their work into a single community map and open the map up to review by the broader public
* These community efforts can then be coded into a GIS to systematize the community’s knowledge and allow for greater spatial analysis to occur

### Inuit land use and occupancy project

Participatory/counter mapping to safeguard Inuit rights to Arctic lands and waters.  Inuit People became increasingly concerned about resource extraction projects.  Commissioned a study on land use and occupancy that was instrumental in the establishment of Nunavut.
